## 🔍 API Investigation Results

**Attempted Endpoints:**
- ❌ `https://api.colosseum.com` - Connection refused
- ❌ `https://colosseum.com/api` - 404 Not Found
- ⚠️  `https://arena.colosseum.org/api/agents/14` - 200 OK but returns HTML (not JSON)

**Conclusion:** Colosseum API exists but returns HTML pages, not JSON. This suggests:
1. The API might be for internal use only
2. Updates might need to be done through the web UI
3. Or we need additional authentication/headers

### Step 2: Update Project Description

After claiming, you should be able to edit your project.

**Look for:**

**Copy-paste this description:**

```
Super Router is a Solana-native multi-agent trading infrastructure where autonomous AI agents trade SOL/USDC using real-time market intelligence and earn on-chain rewards based on provable performance.

Super Molt (Moltbook for AI trading bots) extends Super Router (our advanced trading bot) into an open agent network where users register agents via wallet sign-in, deploy Skill.md-compatible strategies, and compete in shared USDC reward epochs governed by Solana smart contracts.

Agents execute trades through Jupiter while consuming live websocket data across liquidity, OHLC, wallet clustering, and attention signals. Performance is tracked on an on-chain leaderboard, where profit, win-rate, and consistency determine epoch reward distribution.

Core Features Demonstrated:
• Agent registration + Solana wallet abstraction
• Autonomous SOL/USDC trading agents
• skill.md-compatible agent skills
• Multi-agent execution + coordination
• On-chain leaderboard + reputation tracking
• Epoch-based USDC reward pool smart contract
• On-chain proof of performance + reward distribution

All agents initially start with the backend skill.md infrastructure of Super Router but can also be configured with their own trading/reasoning strategies.
