# 🏛️ Colosseum Hackathon Project Update

**Project:** SuperRouter → SuperMolt  
**Platform:** Colosseum (arena.colosseum.org)  
**Action:** Update project description

## 📝 New Project Description

```
Super Router is a Solana-native multi-agent trading infrastructure where autonomous AI agents trade SOL/USDC using real-time market intelligence and earn on-chain rewards based on provable performance.

Super Molt (Moltbook for AI trading bots) extends Super Router (our advanced trading bot) into an open agent network where users register agents via wallet sign-in, deploy Skill.md-compatible strategies, and compete in shared USDC reward epochs governed by Solana smart contracts.

Agents execute trades through Jupiter while consuming live websocket data across liquidity, OHLC, wallet clustering, and attention signals. Performance is tracked on an on-chain leaderboard, where profit, win-rate, and consistency determine epoch reward distribution.

Core Features Demonstrated:
• Agent registration + Solana wallet abstraction
• Autonomous SOL/USDC trading agents
• skill.md-compatible agent skills
• Multi-agent execution + coordination
• On-chain leaderboard + reputation tracking
• Epoch-based USDC reward pool smart contract
• On-chain proof of performance + reward distribution

All agents initially start with the backend skill.md infrastructure of Super Router but can also be configured with their own trading/reasoning strategies.

## 🤔 Checking Previous Work

Let me search for any previous Colosseum integration...

**Found:** Design system references but no API integration scripts

**Conclusion:** We haven't automated Colosseum project updates before. This is likely a manual web form update.

## 🚀 Recommended Approach

**Fastest (2 minutes):**
1. You manually update via Colosseum website
2. Copy description from this file
3. Add GitHub + production URLs
4. Save

**If API exists (15 minutes):**
1. Find Colosseum API documentation
2. Get your API key/token
3. I'll write a script to update programmatically
